## Self-Improvement Loop

After ANY correction from the user:

1. **Capture the lesson** - Update `tasks/lessons.md` with:
   - What went wrong (the mistake or correction)
   - Why it happened (root cause)
   - The rule to prevent it (concrete, actionable)
2. **Write a rule for yourself** that prevents the same mistake from recurring
3. **Review lessons at session start** - Read `tasks/lessons.md` at the beginning of each session and apply relevant lessons to the current project
4. **Iterate ruthlessly** - Refine and consolidate lessons over time; remove outdated ones, sharpen vague ones
